Execution Summary
    • You are hired to perform a web application penetration test on the following target: 185.218.124.165
    • This is a template for uploading your screenshots.
    • The exam objective is to find a way to execute OS system commands on the targeted system. This can be ONLY done by chaining multiple web vulnerabilities. Do not forget to report other vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability reported will grant bonus points.
    • Not all vulnerabilities are giving the same number of points.
    • The order of the vulnerabilities DO NOT MATTER, nor the tools used to get to them.
    • You are free to upload multiple screenshots for each vulnerability, including your path and how did you find it.
    • It does not matter which command you execute. No reverse shell needed, no privilege escalation is needed.
Do not overstress or overcomplicate it. The time is enough, you can do it.
Scope
Scope is open, meaning you can perform your own information gathering and you are free to enumerate the application for vulnerabilities from every angle. 
Appendix 
This is the screenshot section. Make sure to detail each vulnerability. The overall vulnerability count is unknown, try to find as much as possible while following the main objective. It is a good practice to explain your finding. 
When describing your finding, make sure to be as clear as possible by answering the following questions: 
    1. What is the vulnerability I found? 
    2. How did I find it? 
    3. What "bad" can happen, what risk does it carry? 
After the description, make sure to drop your screenshots below.
